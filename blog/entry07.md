### Expo Elevator Pitch
For my expo elevator pitch, I felt like I was loud and clear, making eye contact with the people who came by, as well as the judges. I felt I have learned a lot because of this expo elevator pitch that I was able to become one of the SEP10 showcase finalist, which was an extremely exciting thing to experience!
 * Be sure to always share your ideas out loud
 * Don't feel scared
### In-class Presentation
For my in-class presentation I felt more nervous compared to the elevator pitch because I was speaking in front of the whole class, instead of small groups of people. But I was able to overcome this, leading to my takeaways.
 * Do not be nervous because in the end you will regret not sharing what you know.
 * Try your best when you are presenting
