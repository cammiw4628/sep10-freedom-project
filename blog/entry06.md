### MVP
In class, we started planning to create wireframes for our website to plan towards our MVP. The wireframes were used to plan out our website with no extreme detail before actually coding.  We created a wireframe for both mobile and computer, so that it can be accessible for all users to view the website. MVP is the minimum viable product that has the needed features for a website to be usable.
