For my **Part B** brainstorming idea, I came up with different ideas that can benefit people in the field of psychology. Finding the ideas was a difficult process, so I took inspiration of every day items that can be transformed using technology. Human behavior can be really hard to determine, so I tried to think big and be creative over my ideas for the future technology devices. I thought of ways that the human emotion can be distinguished using my future devices for the future of psychology. Below are my lists of devices I came up with using the idea to understand the human mind.
 * Watch Bracelet
   *   Checks the pulse of a person to understand their feelings
   *   Make different types of beeps that are different vibrations on the wrist of the area that has the bracelet on, when your emotions are either sad, happy, mad, and more, to understand what is causing that type of vibration to occur.
 * Chronic Camera
   *   Camera that detects the facial expression when each picture is being taken
   *   Read facial expressions accurately. 
   *   The camera will keep track of each emotion being displayed and keep it into memory and give additional information to help you with understanding your own emotions. 
   *   To better back up the system, you can manually input your emotion in a specific picture to generate and keep in mind for future pictures you take with the camera. 
   *   Not only can you see the emotions on the camera you can also look into the pictures within the camera to help you understand your own emotions and behaviors, and keep them into consideration and into your memories.
 * Smart Support Animal
   *  A stuffed animal that can detect and give feedback on what you say
   *  The stuffed animal hears your voice each time you press on it like a build-a-bear but it has different responses and you have to physically talk to the support animal, in order for it to talk back.
   *  Generates appropriate answers to questions about your feelings in life.
   *  Has an on and off button if you donâ€™t want to talk to the support animal currently.
 * Smart Glasses
   *  Glasses read brain signals that are keeping you from focusing.
   *  Generates advice to follow whenever you lose focus that can encourage you to increase your attention span.
   *  Above all the glasses can analyze what you enjoy and dislike to generate images that can improve your mood whenever you feel upset.
   *  The glasses can have memory storage to keep in mind what you hate and like to help you avoid feeling a certain negative mood.

## Engineering Design Process
Currently, we are on **step three** of _Engineering Design Process_, where I am coming up with different solutions or requirements for my topic.
