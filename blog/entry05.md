### What I Learned
What I have learned about my tool is that I learned almost everything on the [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) page but I learned some skills by watching a variety of youtube videos to help me tinker with my tool.
Those include..
 * Faster and slower speed
    *    Used to determine the duration of an animation
    *    Can be fast or slow
 * Image animation
    *    Make images more appealing
    *    Outside users can be attracted to look into the website
 * Delay animation
    *    Used to control when the animation will play
    *    Time when you want animation to take place
 * Having multiple animate.css classes in one element
    *    Multiple classes can help the animation be in control of how you want to set it up as 
 * Infinite class animation
    *    Users can feel curious about the animation
    *    Animation can repeat forever 
 * Keyframes
    *    Can be used alongside animate.css to make website more prsentable 
 * Shapes with animation
    *    Shape animations can make people guided towards the website, in order to make them want to learn how to do the animation.
    *    Used to decorate my website      
### How I Learned my Tool
I learned my tool by reading the documentation from the [animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation) page and searched up videos on what I need to know to help me tinker with my tool.

#### Keyframes
What I mainly want to focus on is keyframes because this was the most difficult to me because it took me a long time to figure out ways to tinker with keyframes that can be used with my tool, animate.css.
