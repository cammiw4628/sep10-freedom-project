## Content
The tool I chose was [animate.css](https://animate.style/) because animation is a tool that I would want to learn and incorporate into my project. Animation can make my project stand out more and feel appealing to other people viewing my work. I tinkered  with the tool by first doing the basic tutorial guided in the website. I also added other codes to make it more specific to what I want, such as how long the animation will play and the duration of the animation. 

## Sources
I learned how to use Animate CSS by following the directions on the official website to help with installing and figuring out what codes can be used for my different elements.
