### Choosing my topic
The topic I chose was psychology because I have been interested in learning about this topic for a while now and this gives me a chance to expand my knowledge on psychology. Psychology can help me and those around you by being able to understand human behaviors and understanding myself better as a person. My backup ideas were cooking and photography because I enjoy doing both in my free time but the topic of psychology makes me feel more engaged in learning more, since I have little experience with it.
