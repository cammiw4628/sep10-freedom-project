### Content
Currently, I have researched on Google about my topic psychology. I have seen different websites and expanded my knowledge based on the information that was given from all these websites. Some things I have researched about was **software and hardware** technologies based on my topic of psychology. 

#### What I have found
I first started to find softwares online on google. I searched up _"psychology apps"_ and clicked the first website that caught my eye. This website is [psychology apps](https://careersinpsychology.org/15-psychology-apps-you-should-be-using/) and in this website there are many psychology apps that are helpful to use in order to take control of your own psychological health. I browsed through the apps and looked into some apps deeper to find out what the uses were. After I researched about hardwares in psychology by searching up _"Psychology Gadgets"_ and found the website [psychology gadgets](https://techround.co.uk/tech/mental-health-wearables-gadgets/). In this website there are many different gadgets that psychologists created to help depict human feelings and behaviors in order to help others improve. I took notes on some gadgets that are being used and researched deeper into them.  
Shown below are deeper information on apps and gadgets that I have researched and took notes on.

#### Apps (softwares)
One app I looked into was [TraxItAll](https://www.traxitall.com). This app helps with identifying goals, tracking progress, and setting priorities in life. The app is beneficial because of it's clear instructions for users to understand in order to contribute the app into their daily life. This way the user can be able to accomplish their goals and complete their priorities. Overall, the app _TraxItall_ is clear and straight forward.  

Another app I looked into was [live-happy](https://live-happy.app) and the goal of this app was to promote happiness. The app gives suggestions for activities or exercises that can be incorporated in your daily life. Live-happy also suggests new methods and ideas to use to contribute to living a better life. Mostly this app helps users to living a healthier life by giving users suggestions to use.

####  Gadgets (hardwares)
The first gadget I looked into was _“Baracoda BMind.”_This gadget is basically a AI powered mirror, which looks like:[Baracoda-Bmind-image](https://nexttechtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Baracodas-BMind-The-Worlds-First-Smart-Mirror-Designed-For-Mental-Wellness.jpg). It is the first ever AI powered smart mirror to be created in psychology. This mirror identifies moods, helps manage stress, and recognizes gestures and mental states of a person. This smart mirror comes in handy to understand the human emotions that most people are not able to identify easily.  

Another gadget is _“Muse Headband”_, and looks like: [Muse-Headband-Image](https://i0.wp.com/therevealer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Muse-Poster.jpeg?resize=703%2C369&ssl=1) This headband is wearable to help people focus when they are having trouble and measures/reads brain signals. Once the headband processes these ideas of the brain signals and focus problems, the headband plays gentle audio feedbacks in order to help your mind focus. This gadget is good for helping to calm the human mind when the person can't reach out to someone to speak to during desperate times.

#### How I found it
I found these websites from google and searched up topics that are related to what I need. Examples would be _psychology apps_, _psychology hardwares_, and _psychology gadgets_. How I managed to find websites that I used was by revising what I search up. When I searched up psychology hardwares, I didn't find much good clear websites that I could use. However, I searched up _psychology gadgets_, which showed me a lot of websites that were useful to look through. 

### Engineering Design Process
As of so far, I am on step two of Engineering Design Process. I am researching about psychology software and hardware that will help me with creating this freedom project. Researching will help me expand my thinking of what our world needs in the field of psychology to better benefit everyone. I can get ideas to create that will help better understand the minds of other people and improve their lifestyles. I will soon move on to the next step of brainstorming for my future website that I will create to help others using psychology.

### Skills
I learned a new skill compared to my first blog such as **How to google**. This skill is useful when I was researching the **softwares** and **hardwares** of psychology. Using [https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on](Google) I was able to determine websites that gave me a bigger idea on the topic of psychology. I was able to revise my searches to find websites that were helpful to me and my project. Another skill is **time management** because without time management I would not have been able to find all of these softwares and hardwares in psychology without having enough time. Managing my time helps me complete assignments faster and more efficiently.
