### Content
Currently, I have researched on Google about my topic psychology. I have seen different websites and expanded my knowledge based on the information that was given from all these websites. Some things I have researched about was software and hardware technologies based on my topic of psychology. 
#### What I have found
I first started to find softwares online on google. I searched up _"psychology apps"_ and clicked the first website that caught my eye. This website is [psychology apps](https://careersinpsychology.org/15-psychology-apps-you-should-be-using/) and in this website there are many psychology apps that are helpful to talk and take control of your own psychological health. I browsed through the apps and looked into some apps deeper. 
#### How I found it
I found these websites from google and searched up topics that are related to what I need. Examples would be _"psychology apps"_, _"psychology hardwares"_, and _"psychology gadgets"_. How I managed to find websites that I used was I sometimes revised what I search up. When I searched up psychology hardwares, I didn't find much good clear websites that I could use. However, I searched up psychology gadgets, which showed me a lot of websites that were useful to look through.
