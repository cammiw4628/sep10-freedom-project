### What I Learned
What I have learned about my tool is that I learned almost everything on the [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) page but I learned some skills by watching a variety of youtube videos to help me tinker with my tool for my upcoming freedom project. One video I watched was about [How to Make Basic Shapes](https://youtu.be/eaIZciwSI9s?si=61TSPdHFjaKTDwdZ) that I can include in my future website.     
Some skills are...
 * Faster and slower speed
    *    Used to determine the duration of an animation
    *    Can be fast or slow
 * Image animation
    *    Make images more appealing.
    *    Outside users can be attracted to look into the website.      
 * Delay animation
    *    Used to control when the animation will play.
    *    Time when you want animation to take place.       
 * Having multiple animate.css classes in one element
    *    Multiple classes can help the animation be in control of how you want to set it up as.    
 * Infinite class animation
    *    Users can feel curious about the animation.
    *    Animation can repeat forever.   
 * Keyframes
    *    Can be used alongside animate.css to make website more presentable.    
 * Shapes with animation
    *    Shape animations can make people guided towards the website, in order to make them want to learn how to do the animation.
    *    Used to decorate my website.
### How I Learned my Tool
I learned my tool by reading the documentation from the [animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation) page and searched up videos on what I need to know to help me tinker with my tool. I watched a video that I watched is [How to Make Basic Shapes](https://youtu.be/eaIZciwSI9s?si=61TSPdHFjaKTDwdZ) because I will be animating shapes, which is different than animating text or images and I need to know how to make a shape before actually coding.      

#### Shape Animation
I wanted to try something new instead of only tinkering with text and images because I wanted something that can stand out more to other people. So I decided to use shapes as a way to make things seem more fun rather than using texts and images for animation. After watching the [shape tutorial](https://youtu.be/eaIZciwSI9s?si=61TSPdHFjaKTDwdZ) and coding, I decided to now add animation to the shapes to test if the shapes will be animated. I determined that animation on shapes work perfectly by making and changing animations onto the different shapes. I also added a repeating class,`animate__repeat-3`, that repeats the animation 3 times to be more entertaining.

#### Code
```HTML
<h2>Shape Dance Break!</h2>
<div class="square animate__animated animate__flash animate__repeat-3"></div>
<div class="circle animate__animated animate__flip animate__repeat-3"></div>
<div class="rectangle animate__animated animate__zoomIn animate__repeat-3"></div>
```

## Skills
A skill I was able to develop is learning how to create **shape animations** because instead of using only text and image animations, shapes can feel more appealing compared to them. I want to create a variety with all three for my website and shapes was added along the way that can be much more enjoyable. Another skill is being **creative** because I used my time to determine what I can animate and thought up of something else that can play a significant role in what I want to create for my futre websites. Creativity can be very helpful in many of my upcoming projects and to let my ideas be known and used.
