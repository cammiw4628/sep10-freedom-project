## Content
### Expo Elevator Pitch
For my expo elevator pitch, I felt like I was loud and clear, making eye contact with the people who came by. I have learned a lot because of this expo elevator pitch that I was able to become one of the SEP10 showcase finalist, which was an extremely exciting thing to experience!
 * Be sure to always share your ideas out loud.
 * Do not feel scared.
### In-class Presentation
For my in-class presentation I felt more nervous compared to the elevator pitch because I was speaking in front of the whole class, instead of small groups of people. But I was able to overcome this, leading to my takeaways.
 * Do not be nervous because in the end you will regret not sharing what you know.
 * Try your best when you are presenting

## Engineering Design Process
I currently am on **step 8** of the engineering design process, where I will be communicate the results of my website. I have already finished class presentation and the expo but now I am moving toward the showcase. This will be the very last step when I present my website that I have took the whole year to learn and create. I will be adding this freedom project to my profolio as well, for people to be able to visit and look into the website that I made.
## Skills   
A skill I learned was to be an **effective communicator** by being **better at presenting** than I use to be. In the past I was not as good as presenting trying to avoid all possible eye contact and was not loud enough. I tried my best to overcome this when presenting to put those aside because I got feedback from my last presentation to be louder, in order for it to sound more clear. Another skill I learned is to **not be afraid** because I did not like presenting at all because I get nervous easily and I still do but putting my fears behind me helps me feel more relax and ready for the challenge!
