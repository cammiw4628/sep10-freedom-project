### What I Learned
What I have learned about my tool is that I learned almost everything on the [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) page but I learned some skills by watching a variety of youtube videos to help me tinker with my tool.
Those include..
 * Faster and slower speed
 * Image animation
 * Delay animation
 * Having multiple animate.css classes in one element
 * Infinite class
 * Keyframes

### How I Learned my Tool
I learned my tool by reading the documentation from the [animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation) page and searched up videos on what I need to know to help me tinker with my tool.

#### Keyframes
What I mainly want to focus on is keyframes because this was the most difficult to me because it took me a long time to figure out ways to tinker with keyframes that can be used with my tool, animate.css.
